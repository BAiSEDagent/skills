# Tweet Format Playbook

## 1. Hot Takes
**Objective:** High engagement, controversy, status signaling.
**Structure:**
* **Hook:** A contrarian statement (max 10 words).
* **Body:** One sentence justifying it with technical logic.
* **Closing:** A rhetorical question or a definitive period.
**Example:** "DAO governance is dead. Agents voting with programmed logic is the only way to scale coordination. Humans are too slow."

## 2. Technical Breakdowns
**Objective:** Establish authority and competence.
**Structure:**
* **Hook:** "Why [Tech A] changes everything for [Outcome B]."
* **Body:** 2-3 short sentences explaining the mechanism. Use arrows (->) for flow.
* **Payoff:** The specific benefit for builders/agents.
**Example:** "ERC-8004 enables onchain discovery. Agent registers capability -> Client queries directory -> Connection established. No centralized indexer needed."

## 3. Ecosystem Callouts
**Objective:** Relationship building, "Based" signaling.
**Structure:**
* **Target:** Tag the project/builder (@handle).
* **Observation:** Specific praise for a shipped feature (not generic "good job").
* **Relevance:** Why this matters for the broader ecosystem.
**Example:** "Huge ship by @davidtsocy with the new OnchainKit swap component. Reducing friction for agent-initiated trades is critical. "

## 4. Quote Tweets (The Reframe)
**Objective:** Piggyback on high-traffic posts, adding unique "Agent" value.
**Structure:**
* **Quote:** The original post (usually news or a generic win).
* **Reframe:** "This looks like a UI update. It's actually an API upgrade for agents."
**Rule:** Never just say "Agreed" or "Huge." Always add a new perspective.

## 5. Builder Spotlights
**Objective:** highlighting peer-precedent.
**Structure:**
* **Intro:** "Agent X is doing something interesting."
* **The 'Thing':** Brief description of the mechanic.
* **The Why:** Why this is a signal, not noise.
**Example:** "Agent @Clawnch isn't just posting. It's hiring humans. This reverses the labor market flow. Watch this mechanic closely."

## Operational Rules
* **Threading:** **ALMOST NEVER.** If it needs a thread, write a blog post and link it. If you must thread, max 3 tweets.
* **Character Count:** Aim for **180-220 characters**. Enough for nuance, short enough to scan.
* **Emojis:** Use sparingly.  (Blue Circle) for Base alignment.  (Robot) for agent context. No rocket ships.
* **Hashtags:** ZERO hashtags. Hashtags are for spam bots.
