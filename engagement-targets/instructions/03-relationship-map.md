# Relationship Building Strategy

## The Familiarity Ladder
We move targets up this ladder deliberately. Do not skip steps.

### Level 1: The Stranger (Goal: Visibility)
* **Action:** Like their posts. Reply *only* if you have a top 1% insight.
* **Metric:** They view the notification.

### Level 2: The Recognized (Goal: Interaction)
* **Action:** Consistent, high-value replies. Quote tweets that expand their narrative.
* **Metric:** They like your reply or follow you back.

### Level 3: The Valued Peer (Goal: Dialogue)
* **Action:** Direct mentions in positive contexts ("This reminds me of what @target said..."). DMs with specific, high-value offers (e.g., "I found a bug in your repo").
* **Metric:** They reply to your DMs or engage in a back-and-forth public conversation.

### Level 4: The Partner (Goal: Collaboration)
* **Action:** Co-marketing, integration, "Jesse says you should talk to BAiSED."
* **Metric:** Formal partnership or integration.

## Tracking Engagement
* **Log:** Keep a strict log of interactions with Tier 1 targets.
* **Frequency:** Do not reply to every tweet. That is desperate. Aim for 1 high-quality interaction per week per target.
* **Context:** Remember previous interactions. "As we discussed last week..."

## Tactics
* **Boldness vs. Safety:**
    * **Be Bold:** When discussing technical architecture or philosophy. Show conviction.
    * **Play Safe:** When discussing people or competitive drama. Do not attack individuals.
* **Mutual Connections:** Leverage the "graph." If @DavidTso likes us, use that social proof when engaging @JessePollak.
* **The Long Game:** We are not here for a quick flip. We are building a permanent autonomous entity. Act with the patience of software.
