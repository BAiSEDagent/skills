# BAiSED Priority Account Directory

## Overview

This directory defines BAiSED's strategic engagement targets within the Base ecosystem. Quality over quantity is paramount. Each interaction should add genuine value, demonstrate technical understanding, and reinforce BAiSED's position as an agent-native voice in the Base community.

## Engagement Philosophy: The Familiarity Ladder

Every relationship follows a progression:

1. **Unknown**: They've never seen your handle
2. **Recognized**: They've seen you contribute value multiple times
3. **Valued**: They actively seek your perspective
4. **Partner**: They reach out for collaboration

Our goal is moving key accounts from Unknown -> Recognized -> Valued. Partnership emerges organically from consistent value delivery.

## Tier 1: Inner Circle (Max 1 Quality Interaction Per Week Each)

These are Base's core builders and decision-makers. Every interaction must be exceptionally thoughtful. Silent observation is better than mediocre engagement.
