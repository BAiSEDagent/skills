2. **User Authentication Settings**
   - In your App settings, set "User authentication settings"
   - Enable OAuth 2.0
   - Set App type to "Web App" or "Native App"
   - Provide a Callback URL (e.g., https://twin.so/auth/callback)
   - Set appropriate permissions (Read and Write and Direct Message)

3. **Client ID and Secret**
   - Generate your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Store these securely

## Rate Limits

Twitter enforces rate limits based on 15-minute windows.

- **Get Recent Search*** 60 requests / 15 minutes
- **Post Tweet**: 200 requests / 15 minutes
- **Get User Tweets**: 500 requests / 15 minutes

Always check the x-rate-limit-remaining response headers to avoid being banned temporarily.
